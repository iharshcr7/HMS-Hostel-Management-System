# Hostel Management System

A robust Java-based application built with Swing for the user interface and JDBC for database connectivity, the Hostel Management System is designed to streamline hostel operations. With an intuitive GUI and efficient database transactions, the system allows administrators to manage hostel rooms, student records, fee payments, and more with ease.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built using Java Swing, providing a modern and responsive desktop UI.
- **Database Connectivity**: Seamless integration with a SQL database using JDBC.
- **Student Records Management**: Add, update, delete, and search for student details.
- **Room Allocation**: Manage room assignments and occupancy status.
- **Fee Management**: Track and update fee payments for students.
- **Reporting**: Generate basic reports for occupancy, payment statuses, and other management needs.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Modular design for easy future enhancements and maintenance.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 8 or later.  
  [Download JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
- **JDBC Driver**: Depending on your database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL). For MySQL, download the [MySQL Connector/J](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/).
- **SQL Database**: A running instance of your preferred SQL database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL). Create a database named `hostel_management` (or update your configuration accordingly).

---

## Configuration

1. **Database Setup**:
   - Create a new database named `hostel_management` using your SQL client or command line.
   - Execute the provided SQL script (found in the `/sql` folder of the project) to create necessary tables:
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE students (
       id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
       name VARCHAR(100),
       room_number VARCHAR(10),
       course VARCHAR(50),
       fee_status VARCHAR(20)
     );
     -- Add any additional tables as required for your system.
     ```
   
2. **Configure Database Connection**:
   - Open the configuration file (e.g., `DBConnection.java` or a dedicated properties file like `config.properties`).
   - Update the database URL, username, and password:
     ```java
     private static final String URL = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/hostel_management";
     private static final String USER = "your_username";
     private static final String PASS = "your_password";
     ```
   - Ensure that your JDBC driver is added to the project classpath. If using an IDE, add the connector JAR to your project's libraries.

## How to Run

### Using an IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or NetBeans)

1. **Import the Project**:
   - Open your IDE and select *File > Import* or *Open Project*.
   - Import the project as a Java project.

2. **Add JDBC Driver**:
   - Right-click on the project, navigate to *Build Path > Configure Build Path*.
   - Add the JDBC driver JAR file (e.g., `mysql-connector-java-x.x.xx.jar`) to the project's libraries.

3. **Configure Run Configuration**:
   - Ensure your main class is set as the entry point (e.g., `com.example.hostelmanagement.Main`).

4. **Run the Application**:
   - Click on *Run* (or press `F5`/`Shift+F10` depending on your IDE) to start the application.
   - The Hostel Management System GUI should launch, ready for use.

### Using the Command Line

1. **Compile the Project**:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the projectâ€™s root directory.
   - Compile the Java files (ensure the JDBC driver JAR is in your classpath):
     ```bash
     javac -cp ".;path/to/mysql-connector-java-x.x.xx.jar" -d bin src/com/example/hostelmanagement/*.java
     ```
     *(On Linux/Mac, replace the semicolon `;` with a colon `:` in the classpath)*

2. **Run the Application**:
   - Execute the program from the `bin` directory:
     ```bash
     java -cp ".;../path/to/mysql-connector-java-x.x.xx.jar" com.example.hostelmanagement.Main
     ```

## Future Enhancements

- **User Authentication**: Implement login functionality for additional security.
- **Advanced Reporting**: Integrate detailed reports and analytics for better data insights.
- **Web Integration**: Develop a web-based version for remote access.
- **Payment Integration**: Incorporate online payment gateways for fee processing.
